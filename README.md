## Submission and Evaluation

We split the dataset into two: train data and test data. For the train data, you are given the features and the true labels (in `\data\train`). For the test data you are given only the features but no labels. You are supposed to train your model using train data and submit the prediction of test data.

To submit your prediction:

On the website portal, you will see the public score of your submission, which is calculated using 50% of the test data. The final ranking will be based on the other 50% data (private score).

## Competition Rules

1. You are welcome to use any model for this competition as long as you can explain the algorithm/logic of your solution.
2. The use of LLM is allowed.
3. If we detect any behavior that intends to cheat (hacking, exploiting the evaluaion server, etc.), we have the right to cancel your eligibility.
